// Challenge 1 explanation

Challenge 1 involves creating a C# API with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing entities. 
The provided code defines an interface (IEntity) and classes representing an entity with properties like addresses, dates, deceased status, gender,
ID, and names. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The task is to implement the following:

1.List Entities (GET api/entities):

Provide an endpoint to fetch a list of entities.
The endpoint should support optional searching and filtering capabilities based on fields like address country, address line, first name, middle 
name, and surname.

2. Retrieve Single Entity by ID (GET api/entities/{id}):

Implement an endpoint to retrieve a single entity by its ID.
The code includes a basic setup for an API controller using ASP.NET Core MVC, with data stored in-memory as a list of entities. The GetEntities 
method handles searching and filtering based on the specified fields, while the GetEntityById method retrieves a single entity by its ID.
